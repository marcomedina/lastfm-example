# Step 2 Top10 exercise:
This is the first exercise using rails. Please follow the objectives. Try to use good OOP.

## Rules
* You have 30 minutes to complete this  test
 
## Objective:
* Object Oriented approach is a must. You can make some tests with structured code, but you shouldnâ€™t use that code for the final solution.
* All resources such as artists/songs should be dynamically generated, hard coded resources would be seen as a lack of flexibility on the code base.

* Obtain the top 10 artists and songs from the web. 
** Artists should have a small picture and a name
** Songs should have the album cover and the artist name and if found the album name.
** You can see how the finish product is suppose to look by looking at the 'look_like_so.png'

##Technical Requirements
* Ruby version should not be important but anything over 1.9.3 is preferred
* Rails > 3.2
* Gems that depend on the project (eg. HAML)
* LastFm API http://lastfm.es/api
